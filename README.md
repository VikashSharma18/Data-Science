Perceptron-Based Classification Model
This repository contains a simple implementation of a Perceptron-based classification model. The Perceptron algorithm is one of the foundational algorithms in machine learning, used for binary classification tasks. Despite its simplicity, it provides a strong introduction to the concepts of linear classifiers.
